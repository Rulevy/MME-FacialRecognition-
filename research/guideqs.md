### Ru Levy - Facial Recognition research


Briefly explain the main idea behind the technology you're researching, what is it exactly? what is it for? How does it work?
- artificial technology can recognize human faces and identify attributes about an individual--including gender, age, and ethnicity.
It is a "biometric‚Äù identification system. Scanning an unknown face, the technology uses it's surplus of compiled information to follow the 3 steps: detection, faceprint creation, and verification or identification.


Who are the important people and/or organizations related to this technology? Don't just list names, briefly explain who these are and what their relationship to your research area is.
- Trueface.AI and Kairos are big companies that work on Fraud detection. Their machines can identify human attributes and distinguish a human face from a photograph. MasterCard allows users to verify payments with a photo of themselves through an app.
AiCure's app identifies the patient, identifies the prescribed drug and can visually confirm if the drug has been ingested by the patient.
ePAT works to detect a patient's pain level through facial recognition.
A creepy one is "FaceDeals" who use the technology to give customers, who enter a store, special offers based on their Facebook "like" history.

What are the important historical events/milestones in the development of this technology and why do they seem particularly note worthy?
- Government entities are the biggest consumers of facial recognition technology. The FBI using it, makes security and crime investigation much more efficient.
Even consumer companies have started using it in order to personalize products and in marketing but these methods tend to have backlash.


Draw (literally or figuratively) connections between the technology you are researching and other related technology. This could include sub-categories within your research area and/or technological predecessors and/or technology which is otherwise related to your area.
- Other methods under the category of "biometric" identification include fingerprint matching, retina scanning, iris scanning and voice recognition.
