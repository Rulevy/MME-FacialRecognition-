# Timeline of Facial Recognition AI

- 1960s "father" of facial recognition Woodrow Wilson Bledsoe, uses RAND tablet for a photo classifying system that uses x and y coordinates and compares the metrics to other faces - paired with a face that most closely resembles those metrics -- success was limited by underdeveloped technology.
- 1970s  Goldstein, Harmon, and Lesk increased accuracy by adding 21 specific subjective markers to manual recognition.
- 1988 Sirovich and Kirby applied linear algebra >>Eigenface approach
- 1991 Turk and Pentland discovering how to detect faces within images>> first automatic face recognition.
- early 2000s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) began Face Recognition Vendor Tests (FRVT) to give law enforcement agencies and government information to determine the best ways to use facial recognition technology.
- 2002 Super Bowl, law enforcement officials use facial recognition as a major test --insignificant crime was detected and false positives picked up & the technology's  implementation got a lot of backlash ---it wasn't advanced enough for recognition in large crowds.
- 2009 the Pinellas County Sherriff’s Office created a forensic database>>officers could tap into the photo archives of the state’s Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV) -----By 2011, about 170 deputies had been outfitted with cameras that let them take pictures of suspects that could be cross-checked against the the database>>more arrests and criminal investigations than otherwise possible.
- 2010 Facebook starts to use FR -- bringing up privacy issues but ultimately accepted and more than 350 million photos are uploaded and tagged every day.
- 2011 the government of Panama, partnering with then-U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, authorized a pilot program of FaceFirst’s facial recognition platform --to avoid illicit activity in Panama's airport known drug for smuggling and organized crime.
- most effective way to positively identify dead bodies >> used to help confirm the identity of Osama bin Laden after he was killed in a U.S. raid.
- 2014, The Automated Regional Justice Information System (ARJIS) spread FaceFirst's mobile platform promoting information and data sharing among local, state and federal law enforcement agencies>>>>>>instant identification for people who had no ID or did not want to be identified.
-2015 survey of 150 retail executives by the IT services firm Computer Services Corporation suggested that a quarter of all British shops use facial recognition. Fashion retailers have been especially keen: the survey reported that 59% use some form of facial recognition.
- 2017 the iPhone X is released and advertised for using FR as security
- 2017 "WaaS" is a new face recognition data platform designed to help prevent shoplifting and violent crime.
